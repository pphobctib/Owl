Nineteen owl species are found in the United States. Ranging from the diminutive Elf Owl — the smallest owl on the continent — to the massive Great Gray Owl, these charismatic birds come in many shapes and sizes.

While owls' extraordinary hunting skills, nocturnal habits, and haunting calls are the stuff of legend, the dangers they face are often overlooked. Threats like habitat loss, pesticides, and vehicle collisions have already sent a third of all owl species in the United States into decline.

The Northern Spotted Owl (a subspecies of the Spotted Owl) has been protected by the Endangered Species Act since 1990, and six additional owl species have been placed on Partners in Flight's Yellow Watch List, indicating the need for conservation action.

American Bird Conservancy and other organizations are taking a multipronged approach to helping owls by improving key habitat, banning dangerous pesticides, and pushing for improved protections.

Our List
While some owls depend on specific conditions for survival, others, like the Barn Owl, are remarkably adaptive and are found throughout much of the world. For the purposes of this U.S.-based list, we've used PIF population and conservation data exclusive to the United States and Canada, which do not reflect global numbers. Our alphabetical list includes all owl species that live in or visit the continental United States, regardless of breeding location. Finally, owls are reclusive birds, which increases the difficulty of assessing population changes. In cases where this information is lacking, we have not provided population trends.

Barn OwlBarn owls are one of the many types of owls found in the United States
U.S./Canada Population Estimate: 120,000
Population Trend: Increasing
Habitat: Grasslands, deserts, and agricultural fields
Threats: Habitat loss, vehicle collisions
Note: Besides excellent vision, Barn Owls are extraordinarily sensitive to sound; their ability to locate prey by sound alone is the best of any animal ever tested.

Barred OwlBarred Owl
U.S./Canada Population Estimate: 3,200,000
Population Trend: Increasing
Habitat: Mixed, mature forests
Threats: Deforestation
Note: Barred Owls expanded their range dramatically in the 20th century to include western forests, where they now compete with Spotted Owls.

Boreal OwlBoreal Owl
U.S./Canada Population Estimate: 1,700,000
Population Trend: Unknown
Habitat: Boreal forests
Threats: Deforestation
Note: While it's not uncommon for female owls to be larger than males, the difference is most pronounced in Boreal Owls; female Boreal Owls occasionally weigh twice as much as males.

Burrowing OwlBurrowing Owl
U.S./Canada Population Estimate: 1,100,000
Population Trend: Declining
Habitat: Grasslands
Threats: Habitat loss, pesticides, vehicle collisions, introduced predators
Note: Burrowing Owls live underground and hunt on the ground during the day.
